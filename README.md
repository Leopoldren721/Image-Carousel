# Image Carousel 
INTRODUCTION:
this is one part of the company webiste features I planned to design. Ideally, a image carousel can be implemented into company pictures display on the top of the website. As well as a display of proof of delivery for users (dispatch, customers, accountant) 
photos of POD can be categorized by date, driver, or customers. Left and right buttons is travel through database in some order.

Web-design:
HTML: create buttons and locations 
CSS: design of buttons, loctaion and style editing
JavaScipt: backend function of the image carousel. 

FUTURE IDEAS: 
How to build an actuAL database to store these photos would be the next step, maybe would be something similar like the api call and database send json data from database to the backend. 
database UI to access data
